Official Debi payment gateway integration for WooCommerce. Accept payments with flexible installments and automatic debit.

== Description ==

Debi Payment for WooCommerce is the official payment gateway integration for Debi.pro, allowing your WooCommerce store to accept credit and debit card payments with flexible installment plans.

= Key Features =

* Simple configuration - Set up in minutes
* Flexible installment plans - Up to 12 installments
* Customizable interest rates - Configure interest for each installment plan
* Automatic debit - Schedule recurring payments
* Sandbox mode - Test before going live
* Secure payments - PCI-compliant payment processing
* Full WooCommerce integration - Works seamlessly with your existing WooCommerce store
* Translation ready - Full internationalization support

= How It Works =

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Configure your Debi API keys (a single secret + publishable pair; the environment is inferred from the key prefix)
3. Set up your desired installment plans with interest rates
4. Customers can now select from your configured payment plans during checkout

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.5 or higher
* PHP 8.1 or higher
* WooCommerce 3.0 or higher

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
2. Navigate to Plugins → Add New
3. Search for "Debi Payment for WooCommerce"
4. Click "Install Now"
5. Activate the plugin
6. Configure the plugin at WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Debi

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the plugin zip file
2. Extract it to your WordPress plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/)
3. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
4. Navigate to Plugins
5. Find "Debi Payment for WooCommerce" and click "Activate"
6. Configure the plugin at WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → Debi

= Configuration =

1. Go to WooCommerce → Settings → Payments
2. Find "Debi" and click "Manage"
3. Enable the payment method
4. Enter your Debi API keys (a single pair):
   * Secret key (sk_test_... for sandbox, sk_live_... for production)

   The environment is inferred from the prefix — there is no separate "sandbox mode" switch.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the Debi payment platform (https://debi.pro) to process payments.

* Payment API — checkout and webhook data is sent to https://api.debi.pro (production) or https://api.debi-test.pro (sandbox). Data transmitted includes customer name, email address, national identification number (when provided), and a single-use payment-method token generated by the browser-side SDK. Raw card numbers are never transmitted to or stored on your server.
* Card tokenisation SDK — the JavaScript library at https://js.debi.pro/v1/ is loaded on the checkout page. It captures card data directly in the browser and returns a one-time token; raw card numbers are never exposed to your site.

These services are provided by DEBI. Please review their terms and privacy policy before using this plugin:

== Privacy Policy ==

This plugin transmits customer data (name, email, order details, and a browser-generated payment-method token) to Debi's payment infrastructure to complete transactions. Raw card numbers are never stored on your server or sent through WordPress — they are captured directly by the Debi browser SDK and exchanged for a single-use token.

No payment or card data is stored in your WordPress database. For full details on how Debi handles this data, refer to the Debi privacy policy at https://debi.pro/en/privacy.
