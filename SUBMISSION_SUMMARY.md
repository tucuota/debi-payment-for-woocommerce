## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Before Submission (Critical)
1. **Create Plugin Assets**:
   - [ ] Plugin icon: `assets/icon-256x256.jpg` (256x256 pixels)
   - [ ] Plugin banner: `assets/banner-772x250.jpg` (772x250 pixels)
   - [ ] Screenshots: At least 1 in `assets/screenshots/` (880x660 pixels, PNG)

2. **Translation Files**:
   - [ ] Generate `.pot` file for translators
   - [ ] Consider creating Spanish translations since plugin text is in Spanish

3. **Final Code Review**:
   - [ ] Test plugin activation
   - [ ] Test plugin functionality
   - [ ] Test plugin deactivation
   - [ ] Test plugin uninstallation
   - [ ] Test payment processing in sandbox mode

### After Submission
1. Monitor SVN repository for any issues
2. Respond to reviewer feedback
3. Update plugin description/banners if needed
4. Fix any security or code quality issues
5. Resubmit with corrections

## Important Notes

### Linter Errors
The linter shows many "undefined" errors for WordPress and WooCommerce functions. These are **false positives** because:
- The plugin is not running in a WordPress environment
- The linter doesn't have access to WordPress/WooCommerce core functions
- This is completely normal for WordPress plugin development

**These errors will not affect the plugin** when installed in an actual WordPress environment.

### Nonce Verification
WooCommerce payment gateways typically handle nonce verification through WooCommerce's built-in form handling. The current implementation follows standard WooCommerce payment gateway patterns, where form validation is managed by WooCommerce's process_payment() method.

### Output Escaping
Started escaping output in the payment fields. For production, consider:
- Escaping all echo statements
- Using esc_attr() for attributes
- Using esc_html() for text content
- Using esc_url() for URLs
